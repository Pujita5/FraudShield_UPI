# 🚨 FraudShield UPI  
### Machine Learning–Driven Fraud Detection System for UPI Transactions

FraudShield UPI is a web-based fraud detection system that uses machine learning to identify suspicious UPI transactions. The project demonstrates how modern AI techniques can be applied to financial transaction data to improve fraud detection accuracy and provide real-time analytics through an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Detect fraudulent UPI transactions using machine learning
- Handle highly imbalanced transaction data
- Compare traditional ML algorithms with an advanced proposed model
- Provide a real-time, user-friendly web interface for analysis and visualization

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### Baseline Models (Comparative Study)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest  
**Best observed accuracy:** 85.9%

### Proposed Model
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- Feature Scaling
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- XGBoost Classifier  

**Achieved Accuracy:** ~99.4%

The proposed system significantly improves fraud detection performance by addressing class imbalance and complex feature interactions.

## 🧪 Dataset

* Synthetic UPI transaction dataset
* Features include:

  * Transaction Amount
  * Transaction Frequency
  * Location Change
  * Device Change
  * Merchant Risk Score
* Highly imbalanced fraud vs non-fraud data

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics
